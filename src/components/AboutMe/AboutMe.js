            Hello again! Thanks for taking a look at my portfolio website.{" "}
            <span>
              I'm an aspiring developer trained in Full Stack Development at the
              School of Code.
            </span>{" "}
            In my previous work as a Business Systems Analyst, I always enjoyed
            finding solutions that helped others. But I wanted to be able to do
            more, and be able to build these solutions for myself -{" "}
            <span>I wanted to be a developer!</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Once I began learning to code, I knew it was the career path for me
            and enrolled in the<span> School of Code </span>bootcamp. It teaches
            the fundamentals of programming, how to work in a high performance
            tech team, and how to work to industry best practices and standards.
            I've had the
            <span> time of my life </span>learning to code and building projects
            since last year, and am<span> taking this energy forward </span>into
            my new career as I continue to work on developing my skills.
          </p>
