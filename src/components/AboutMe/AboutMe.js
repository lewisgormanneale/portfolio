            In my previous job as a Business Systems Analyst,{" "}

              I always enjoyed finding solutions that helped others
            </span>
            . But I wanted to be able to do more, and be able to build these
            solutions for myself -{" "}
            <span className="emphasise">I wanted to be a developer</span>. Once
            I began learning to code, I knew it was the career path for me and
            enrolled onto the School of Code, an intensive 16-week full-time
            bootcamp which I highly recommend to anyone interested.

              {" "}
              effective communicator, team player and problem-solver

            able to clearly break down, understand and explain problems to
            others, and I found that all of these skills I had developed in
            previous roles translated extremely well into this new career path.
            I had the time of my life learning to code and building projects,
            both for the course and in my spare time. Now, I'm
            <span className="emphasise"> taking this energy forward </span>
            into my new career as I continue to work on improving my skills.
