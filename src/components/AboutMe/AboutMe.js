            I'm an aspiring developer currently enrolled at the School Of Code
            bootcamp learning Full Stack Development.

            Previously in my career, I'd worked in areas such as IT, QA, and
            Technical Support. However, after years of having clients and
            coworkers kindly tell me I was 'good with computers', I increasingly
            felt limited by my lack of coding knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once I began to learn to code in my spare time, I immediately knew
            it was what I wanted to do as a career. I applied for the School of
            Code and haven't looked back!
